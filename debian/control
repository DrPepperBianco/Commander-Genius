Description: Engine used to play the "Commander Keen" game series
 Commander-Genius aka CloneKeenPlus is an engine which interprets
 Commander Keen 1-6 (Vorticons and Galaxy Series).
 .
 As fans and developers we try to implement new features, improve the
 gameplay and give the feeling, you are playing the original game.
 .
 Obviously you need the game data of the games to play it.
 No worries, we provide an integrated stores where you download
 them automatically and let CG configure everything for you.
 Episode 2, 3, 5 and 6 are registered versions which can be
 purchased by 3D Realms or Apogee, or bought by someone else.
 If you still have the old games of the registered version,
 then copy those into a reachable directory and give it a try.
